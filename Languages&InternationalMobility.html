                    The universities seem as big as small towns and have an excellent academic level known worldwide. In addition, travelling would enable me to improve my English.

The double degree program would allow me to acquire a strong specialization in artificial intelligence, while complementing the network-related skills I have developed at ENSEEIHT.
                    The quality and diversity of AI-focused courses perfectly match my interests and my long-term ambition to specialize in this field. Furthermore, obtaining a double degree abroad is a major asset for the international career I aspire to build. Studying in Canada would also offer the opportunity to experience a new academic culture and different teaching methods, contributing to both my personal and professional development.
